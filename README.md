# Luck Game in Python üé≤  
This is a simple luck-based game developed in Python, where the goal is to guess a secret number between 0 and 10. The player has 5 chances to guess correctly, and the score is determined by the attempt in which the number is guessed correctly.  

## Game Rules:  
- The secret number is randomly generated by the program.  
- The player has 5 attempts to guess the number.  
- The score is assigned as follows:  
  - **100 points if guessed on the 1st attempt**  
  - **80 points if guessed on the 2nd attempt**  
  - **60 points if guessed on the 3rd attempt**  
  - **40 points if guessed on the 4th attempt**  
  - **20 points if guessed on the 5th attempt**  

- **If the player does not guess, the game continues until they choose to stop. At the end, the total score is displayed.**  

## How to Play:  
1. Run the Python script.  
2. Enter a number between 0 and 10 to try to guess the secret number.  
3. Keep playing until you guess it or decide to stop.  
4. View your total score at the end of the game.
